    <h1>Welcome to BudgetEngine.io</h1>
    <h3>Demo</h3>
    <p>This is a demo version of BudgetEngine. The database will be purged weekly. BudgetEngine can be entirely self-hosted so that you don't have to worry about dataleaks or prying eyes viewing your financial information.</p>
    <p>In the future, more features will be added to syncronize with your bank accounts and credit cards as well as more manipulations to running a balance projection. Synchrnoizing may only be available on cloud-based instances.</p>
    <p>For now, you can create a new account or login with a test account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Username: amber.nichols</li>
        <li>Password: password</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information, visit the repo on <a href="https://github.com/johnavitable/BudgetEngine">GitHub</a>!</p>
    <h3>BudgetEngine is built for simplicity on 4 fundamental concepts:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Accounts</li>
        <li>Revenues</li>
        <li>Expenses</li>
        <li>Projections</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Accounts contain your posted transactions, revenues, expenses, and projections.  Revenues are the money you earn.  Expenses are the money you spend.  Projections are the future money you expect to earn or spend.</p>
    <p>If you keep BudgetEngine updated with the transactions that you post to your account, it can project what your account balance will be in the future, helping keep you on track.</p>
